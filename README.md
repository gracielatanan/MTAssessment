# Mint Token

This project is about how the owner can mint, transfer, and burn tokens. The purpose of this project is to know how this functions will work and to understand what's going to happen when you interact with the code.

## Description

This project is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a function that the owner can mint, transfer, and burn tokens. This project serve as a simple introduction on how this token distribution work.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., minttoken.sol). 

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.25" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile minttoken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "minttoken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it. Click on the "minttoken" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the function that you have. Finally! click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the message that you insert in your function.
